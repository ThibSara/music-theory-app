# DoRÃ©Mi Lingo ! 

## The concept

## Figma design
### How did we use figma
We used Figma to organise our ideas, make a moodboard and a graphic chart. 
We also used it to first create a wireframe and then a mockup
It was really helpful for the coding part because figma offers the posibility to have de dev mode to help coding

### The different pages
In that figma we organised the app so that it was easier to code it. 
Here are the pages for our app : 
- A login
- An account creation
- A homepage
- The pages of the course
- The pages of the games
- The presentation of the app
